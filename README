pg_monitoring: A PostgreSQL Monitoring Extension
By Chris Travers
================================================

This extensions provides a basic monitoring extension for PostgreSQL, allowing
you to extract monitoring statistics  in a variety of forms, to be consumed by
a variety of monitoring solutions.

It is minimalistic and may need to be expanded.

The basic functions can be listed by \dx+ pg_monitoring.

The pg_monitoring_load_across_tables() function has a significant caveat in
that it shows the difference since last run.  Therefore you must process all
stats you care about on each run.
